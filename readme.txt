In this project we implement a diet program based on a person bmi. We have two files. First file is "Date.csv"
in this file we have a list of persons with name, surname,phone,age,height,weight, and second file is"bmi2.csv".
in the second file on first line we have the bmi range and on the rest of it the menu/days with how much calories
we need to eat. The program parse the first file and make some validations (if name/surname or phone) are correct, 
then we calculate the bmi based on age,height and weight. At the end we asign a menu to a person based on their
bmi.
